# Checklist
This checklist guide me through this Machine Learning projects.

## Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture
- ~~Define the objective in business terms.~~
- ~~How will your solution be used?~~
- ~~What are the current solutions/workarounds (if any)?~~
- How should performance be measured?
- Is the performance measure aligned with the business objective?
- What would be the minimum performance needed to reach the business objective?
- ~~What are comparable problems? Can you reuse experience or tools?~~
- ~~Is human expertise available?~~
- ~~How would you solve the problem manually?~~
- ~~List the assumptions you (or others) have made so far.~~
- ~~Verify assumptions if possible.~~

## Get the Data
- ~~List the data you need and how much you need.~~
- ~~Find and document where you can get that data.~~
- ~~Check how much space it will take.~~
- ~~Check legal obligations, and get authorization if necessary.~~
- ~~Get access authorizations.~~
- ~~Create a workspace (with enough storage space).~~
- ~~Get the data.~~
- ~~Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate (without changing the data itself).~~
- ~~Ensure sensitive information is deleted or protected (e.g., anonymized).~~
- ~~Check the size and type of data (time series, sample, geographical, etc.).~~
- ~~Sample a test set, put it aside, and never look at it (no data snooping!).~~

## Explore the Data
Note: try to get insights from a field expert for these steps.

- ~~Create a copy of the data for exploration (sampling it down to a manageable size if necessary).~~
- ~~Create a Jupyter notebook to keep a record of your data exploration.~~
- ~~Study each attribute and its characteristics:~~
    - Name
    - Type (categorical, int/float, bounded/unbounded, text, structured, etc.)
    - % of missing values
    - Noisiness and type of noise (stochastic, outliers, rounding errors, etc.)
    - Possibly useful for the task?
    - Type of distribution (Gaussian, uniform, logarithmic, etc.)
- ~~For supervised learning tasks, identify the target attribute(s).~~
- ~~Visualize the data.~~
- ~~Study the correlations between attributes.~~
- ~~Study how you would solve the problem manually.~~
- ~~Identify the promising transformations you may want to apply.~~
- ~~Identify extra data that would be useful (go back to “Get the Data” on page 498).~~
- ~~Document what you have learned.~~

## Prepare the Data
- Notes:
    - Work on copies of the data (keep the original dataset intact).
    - Write functions for all data transformations you apply, for five reasons:
    - So you can easily prepare the data the next time you get a fresh dataset
    - So you can apply these transformations in future projects
    - To clean and prepare the test set
    - To clean and prepare new data instances once your solution is live
    - To make it easy to treat your preparation choices as hyperparameters

- Data cleaning:
    - Fix or remove outliers (optional).
    - Fill in missing values (e.g., with zero, mean, median...) or drop their rows (or columns).
- Feature selection (optional):
    - Drop the attributes that provide no useful information for the task.
- Feature engineering, where appropriate:
    - Discretize continuous features.
    - Decompose features (e.g., categorical, date/time, etc.).
    - Add promising transformations of features (e.g., log(x), sqrt(x), x^2, etc.).
    - Aggregate features into promising new features.
- Feature scaling: standardize or normalize features.

## Short-List Promising Models
- Notes:
    - If the data is huge, you may want to sample smaller training sets so you can train many different models in a reasonable time (be aware that this penalizes complex models such as large neural nets or Random Forests).
    - Once again, try to automate these steps as much as possible.

- Train many quick and dirty models from different categories (e.g., linear, naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forests, neural net, etc.) using standard parameters.
- Measure and compare their performance.
    - For each model, use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N folds.
- Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm.
- Analyze the types of errors the models make.
    - What data would a human have used to avoid these errors?
- Have a quick round of feature selection and engineering.
- Have one or two more quick iterations of the five previous steps.
- Short-list the top three to five most promising models, preferring models that make different types of errors.

## Fine-Tune the System
- Notes:
    - You will want to use as much data as possible for this step, especially as you move toward the end of fine-tuning.
    - As always automate what you can.

- Fine-tune the hyperparameters using cross-validation.
    - Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when you are not sure about them (e.g., should I replace missing values with zero or with the median value? Or just drop the rows?).
    - Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach (e.g., using Gaussian process priors, as described by Jasper Snoek, Hugo Larochelle, and Ryan Adams).
- Try Ensemble methods. Combining your best models will often perform better than running them individually.
- Once you are confident about your final model, measure its performance on the test set to estimate the generalization error.

## Present Your Solution
- Document what you have done.
- Create a nice presentation.
    - Make sure you highlight the big picture first.
- Explain why your solution achieves the business objective.
- Don’t forget to present interesting points you noticed along the way.
    - Describe what worked and what did not.
    - List your assumptions and your system’s limitations.
- Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations or easy-to-remember statements (e.g., “the median income is the number-one predictor of housing prices”).

## Launch!
- Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs, write unit tests, etc.).
- Write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.
    - Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to “rot” as data evolves.
    - Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g., via a crowdsourcing service).
    - Also monitor your inputs’ quality (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor sending random values, or another team’s output becoming stale). This is particularly important for online learning systems.
- Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible).
